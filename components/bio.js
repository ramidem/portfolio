      </h3>
      <p>
        Hi. I am Med. I am a self-taught Fullstack Web Developer from the
        Philippines.
      </p>
      <p>
        In June of 2020, during the highest peak of the pandemic, I took a leap
        of faith &mdash; career shift &mdash; and attended a Coding Bootcamp so
        I can further my knowledge in Web Development.
