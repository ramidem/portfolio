  "Hi. I am Med. I am a self-taught Fullstack Web Developer from the Philippines. In June of 2020, during the highest peak of the pandemic, I attended a Coding Bootcamp for a guided learning experience and as a 'push' so I can take a leap of faith. I am grateful to my wife for letting me focus on my passion and my daughter for being such a blessing.";
